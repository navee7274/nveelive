      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        I am a college student with a passion for problem-solving and creating things to simplify everyday tasks, whether in the digital world or
        real-life situations. Over the past 5+ years, I have gained experience in Arduino, graphic design, 3D modeling, and web development. While
        working in the media unit of my school, I have assisted my colleagues in solving their computer-related issues and other problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        I take a long-lasting and reliable approach to delivering solutions and creating things, regardless of the effort involved. I am constantly
        seeking new challenges and opportunities to expand my skills and knowledge. Whether it's developing a new website, designing a logo, or
        creating a functional prototype, I am always excited to tackle new projects and bring ideas to life. My goal is to continue learning and
        growing in the field of technology and innovation.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am currently seeking new knowledge to improve my skills and develop a full-stack website, something I have wanted to do for a long time.
